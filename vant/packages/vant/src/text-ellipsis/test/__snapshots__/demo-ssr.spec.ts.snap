    That day, I turned twenty-one. In the golden age of my life, I was full of dreams. I wanted to love, to eat, and to instantly transform into one of these clouds, part alight, part darkened.

In the end you are no different from a crushed ox. But I hadn&#39;t foreseen any of it on my twenty-first birthday. I thought I would be vigorous forever, and that nothing could ever crush me.
